## Matt's dotfiles

This stuff is not anonymized, my personal info abounds - please fork this repo or at least edit your local copy before using!

To use, just clone this repo and then `rake install` to generate symlinks in your home folder. It won't eat your existing dot files, so you may want to move them out of the way first. Check out the Rakefile for further insight.
